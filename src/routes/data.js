Top secret stuff and hopefully it will be a success.\n\n I am also always looking for opportunities to help small businesses. Projects I am involved with are a community farmer app for some hippies in San Diego, an e-commerce/blog site for an author, IoT scanner thing for a restaurant in Nashville, and an immigrant community marketplace in Germany.'

	text: 'After too many years in higher education I gained a strong foundation in statistics. This led to my first job as a Data Scientist in Phoenix. Before LLMs, machine learning was a black art. I had a fulfilling job at a SaaS company. Unfortunately, that company lost many clients when interest rates went up and I was laid off.\n\n This was a great opportunity to go into something new. I joined a young logistics company in Nashville and helped automate a lot of their boring repetitive tasks, in house applications and pricing models. I became a full stack developer that has basic frontend skills.'
